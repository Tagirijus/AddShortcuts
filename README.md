Features
-------------

- `?` opens updated short cut list
- `F` opens the drop down _(new since v2.0.0)_

- `v+N` where _N_ is any number between 0 and 9. You can set up custom links in the config. This way you could e.g. assign `/?controller=SearchController&action=index&search=status%3Aopen` so that the respecting shortcut will lead to the filter searching all open tasks.
